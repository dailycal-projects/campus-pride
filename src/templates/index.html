        <p align='center'>For Pride Month, we looked at the LGBTQ+ student community at UC Berkeley over time. Based on survey data, we visualized the breakdown in sexual orientation and how respected students felt on campus.</p>
        </div>
      <div class='story'>
      {% include "partials/stacked_orientation.html" %}
        <p align='center'>In 2008, the percent of students identifying as “gay/lesbian,” “questioning/unsure,” and “queer” were 2.2%, 1.5%, and 0.6%, respectively. Since then, the proportion of Berkeley students identifying as non-heterosexual has more than doubled: those numbers are now 3.9%, 3.3%, and 2.6%. There was also a dramatic increase in the proportion of bisexual students, tripling from 2.9% to 9.5% across the 12-year span.</p>
        </div>
      {% include "partials/stacked_respect.html" %}
      <div class='story'>
        <p align='center'>In 2014, 38.4% of students strongly agreed that individuals identifying their sexual orientation are respected on campus. This percentage has decreased from 2014 to 2020, with the percentage in 2020 being 33.1%. The percentage of students who strongly disagreed doubled from 2014 to 2020 from being 0.6% to 1.3%. The most common answer was that students agreed that individuals with their sexual orientation are respected on campus, ranging from 45.6% in 2014 to 47.9% in 2020.</p>
        </div>
      <center>{% include "partials/pie.html" %}</center>
      <div class='story'>
        <p align='center'>Female-identifying students are over-represented in the sample, persistently making up 57 to 59 percent of the respondents. According to internal data, they make up just 52 percent of the total campus population. From 2010 to 2020, the number of transgender respondents rose from 15 to 34, while the number of nonbinary respondents rose from 38 to 135. Still, these two groups combined make up less than 2% of the 11,667 respondents.

<h4>About this story</h4>

  These data were sourced from the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 UC Undergraduate Experiences Surveys. All UC Berkeley undergraduate students enrolled in the spring semesters were invited to participate. Participation was voluntary and response rates ranged from 29 to 50 percent, so the results should be treated with caution.
